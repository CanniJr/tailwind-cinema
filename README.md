This is a web app created using NEXT.js (a React Framework) and designed with tailwind CSS.
    Packages added:
    - Tailwind CSS (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs for a guide on installing Tailwind CSS on a  NEXT app)
    - JIT (Just in Time Compiler) for Tailwind CSS
    - Hero Icons (Works with Tailwind)
    - React Flip Move 

    - Benefits of using NEXT.js:
        1. Server Side Rendering
        2. Out-of-the-box react router function
        3. A more organized code base

This note will be updated as I progress through the build.
